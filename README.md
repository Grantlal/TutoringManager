# TutoringManager
Software Engineering: 465 Architecture project Location

Angular project that will exemplify features of a tutoring management system. 
Some of these include: 
    -Discussion boards
    -TA on demand
    -Chatbot?
    
Requirements To run:

Install node :)
Then on console run: npm install -g @angular/cli
This will install angular for you. 
Next you should be able to to just ng serve this bad boy. 
-Might have to install bootstrap I have no idea if so do this:
npm install bootstrap
npm install ngx-bootstrap --save

These just allow for certain resources to be utilized in the project, I don't think they're necessary though.
